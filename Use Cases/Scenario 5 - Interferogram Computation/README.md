# Use Case Scenario #5 - Interferogram Computation

## Story

The use case describes an advanced story where the main user processes Sentinel-1 SLC data to generate an interferogram over an area of interest. He uses the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) to generate the interferogram and does the interferogram phase unwrapping relying on a CLI utility called snaphu. 

The main user selects Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex acquisitions over an area of interest. After having selected the reference acquisition (previously referred to as master), he uses the catalog discovery mechanism to select the other acquisition (previously referred to as slave) setting the same track (orbit) same orbit direction and an overlap of at least 80% between the two acquisitions.

The main user creates a bash script that creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for SNAP and does a system call to the SNAP gpt utility to process it. The DAG includes all the steps for the unwrapped interferogram generation. 


## User Profile 

The user is an environmental scientist with intermediate computer science training. He can program in bash and has an advanced knowledge of the SNAP toolbox.

## Question & Context

> How suitable is the platform for our user wishing to generate interferograms from Sentinel-1 products?
